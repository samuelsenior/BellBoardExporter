# BellBoardExporter
A tool to export performances from BellBoard in PDF and CSV formats.

Standalone executables have been provided for Windows, Mac, and Linux, so Python doesn't have to be installed to use this tool.

## Usage
Open BellBoardExporter and fill in the fields to give the desired BellBoard search result. Type in the output filename and hit download. A PDF and a CSV file of all the BellBoard performances found in the search result are then downloaded.

Each ringing length selected downloads as a seperate file, with the respective lengths being included on the end of the filenames. This allows multiple ringng lengths to be downloaded with the click of a single button.

## Requirements to run the Python script
* Python 3
* requests (installed via pip)
* pypdf2 (installed via pip)
